## Overview & Objectives

### Research questions:
* What are the main characteristics of a used car which have the most impact on the car price? 

## Data
* 'make'
* num-of-doors
* body-style
* drive-wheels
* engine-location
* wheel-base
* length
* width
* height
* curb-weight
* engine-type
* num-of-cylinders
* engine-size
* fuel-system
* bore
* stroke
* compression-ratio
* horsepower
* peak-rpm
* city-mpg
* highway-mpg
* price
* city-L/100km
* horsepower-binned
* fuel-type-diesel
* fuel-type-gas

## Methodology
### Data Cleaning:
* Familiarized myself with the data.
* Displayed descriptive statistical metrics
### Data Wranglign:
* Replaced null values with useful ones, such a mean values or other useful values.
* Calculated means of selected columns to understand trends in data.
* Changed data types.
* Standardization of data metrics.
* Normalized data.
* Created histogram to understand trends in horsepower in data.
* Created indicator variables to create categorical binary variables (e.g. whether car use gas or diesel)
## Exploratory Data Analysis:
* Linear regression.
* ANOVA hypothesis testing and F-testing.
* P-value and Pearson Correlation Coefficient asssessment.
* Descriptive statistical analysis.
* Value counts and statistics by grouping


## Used Tools
* Matplotlib
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Seaborn
* Scipy
